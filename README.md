Morj is a programming language for Minecraft Datapacks.

Since development started when Minecraft 1.21 version was released, it's designed to use all new features as
base of the core libraries and features.

## Development

To configure pre-commit hooks use:

```shell
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

It'll run sanity checks before each commit. To run all checks use:

```shell
./gradlew test
```
